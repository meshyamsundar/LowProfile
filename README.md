# Low Profile

A Mac utility to help inspect Apple Configuration Profile [payloads](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/profile-specific_payload_keys):

![Example](Readme%20Resources/Example.png)

- [x] Want to see what is inside the Configuration Profiles that are installed on your Mac?
- [x] Curious to know what a Configuration Profile will enforce / change on a device before actually installing one?
- [x] Tired of having to manually un-sign Configuration Profiles, only to have to flex your XML parsing skills to find out what is inside?
- [x] Maybe you just want to qualify that your MDM vendor is creating Configuration Profiles the way you expect?

If the answer is yes to any of the above, then **Low Profile** is the app for **you!**
